# ReqPat
### Efficient Documentation of High-Quality Requirements using Controlled Natural Language

### Motivation
- Increasing complexity of intelligent technical systems
- Increasing size of requirements specifications
- Required compliance to domain-specific development standards

### Benefits
- High-quality requirements by design
- Reduced effort for requirements reviews and transition to model-based development
- Improved traceability and impact analysis from textual requirements to model-based work products

### Installation
Tested with Eclipse Release "2019-06"

1. Download, install and run [Eclipse Modeling Tools 2019-06](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/)
2. Add the following update sites using the "Install new software" menu entry in the "Help" menu
    - RMF Update Site: http://download.eclipse.org/rmf/updates/releases
    - UnitTests: https://dl.bintray.com/itemis/generic/xtext-testing/updates/
    - Sphinx: http://download.eclipse.org/sphinx/releases/0.11.x
3. Install the following extensions:
	- XText SDK
	- RMF SDK
	- OCL Examples and Editors SDK
	- XText Testing (for the unit tests)
	- Sphinx
4. Clone the ReqPat Git Repository into your Eclipse workspace
5. Create a new "Run Configuration" in Eclipse of type "Eclipse Application"

#### Constructive Support for Requirements Documentation
- Context-based pattern suggestions
- Auto completion
- Error highlighting

#### Automatic Analyses for Requirements Validation
- Syntactic checks while writing
- Semantic checks by the press of a button
