The Multibinding source has been put here, as the Multibinding library does not seem to work with the Google Guice version that ships with Eclipse. See this bug report for more details:

https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=366288

Additionally, some references have been updated to use the Google common collections instead of the collections that ship with Guice.
If you need to update the sources simply redo these changes by using the Organize Imports functionality of Eclipse (CONTROL + SHIFT + O).

The Multibinding version that has been used is 3.0.
